<b>*COVID-19 POLICY*</b> <br>
All guests attending indoor performances at Mr. Smalls Theatre and The Funhouse at Mr. Smalls will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination (a clear and legible copy or photo of your COVID-19 vaccination card, with the last dose administered no less than 14 days prior to entry) or a negative COVID-19 test result (received within the previous 72 hours and administered by an official testing center), along with a government issued ID.<br>
<br>
These policy requirements may change at the artist or venue discretion.<br>
<br>
Curative offers PCR COVID-19 testing on MOST show days at Mr. Smalls from 6 - 9:30pm. These test results usually arrive within 24-48 hours. We encourage attendees to schedule a PCR test in advance of your show date if you need to present a negative test for entry.

2.  Purchase your own at home rapid test from any drug store and bring it to this appointment (Curative will not have any rapid tests on site). <br>
3.  DO NOT TAKE THIS TEST AT HOME! <br>
